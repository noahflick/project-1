Description of "coding.dead":
coding.dead is a turn-based rpg, named "coding.dead" played in the browser.
one by one, students start to become zombies, and you must battle them to escape a series of locations and win the game.
Based on the group of students in our class, the game generates narrative through random
selection of a student to become the zombie, and other students are featured in text throughout.

Technologies used:
the game exists as 3 files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
upon loading, the html and css elements are presented, then altered throughout the game
via DOM manipulation in the javascript file, using javascript and jQuery. 
The game logic and all stored data is in javscript. Arrays and objects containing location, 
player, non-player character, enemy, and other data are accessed and updated as the game progresses.

Design Approach:
The game is intended to be a journey through several locations. this was the basis of the graphical presentation.
as events happen, the player is informed of events through text and visual feedback. injecting humor and customization was
a central component. Structure and concepts were implemented that affect future iterations of the game beyond the first level.

Installation instructions:
simply go to http://noahflick.github.io/project-1 to play.

Next Steps:
currently, the game is marginally playable, with one very bare-bones level, and not very much content.
features that have not yet made it into the game, but are planned to be implemented are:
--multiple levels/locations
--overarching story
--visual representation of the characters/enemies
--dynamically generated options for actions and scenarios
